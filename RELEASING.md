# Releasing

This document is intended for project maintainers
([@eliocp](https://github.com/eliocp)). The document describes how the package may be
built and published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and how [GitHub
releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
may be created after successful merge pull requests.

## Requirements

To publish the package to PyPI and create a GitHub release, you would need:
* [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) project manager.
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) version control system.
* Repo owner [`eliocp`](https://github.com/eliocp) set as a [trusted
  publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/#github-actions)
  of the [PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/pingi/).

## Release Workflow

### 1. Approve pull request

* Review a pull request into main, provide comments, request changes if necessary, and
  approve it when appropriate.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Automatic executions after approval of a pull request
> As defined in the GitHub workflow file
> [`ci.yml`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml),
> several checks are executed by GitHub after a pull request being approved:
> * Code lint check (using [`ruff check`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/)).
> * Code format check (using [`ruff format
>   --check`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)).
>
> Note that although the workflow uses `push` to in the mapping of the trigger,
> approval of pull requests are also included since these always involve a push.
> Also note that regardless of any fail in workflow, the completion of the pull
> request proceeds.

### 2. Update project version

* Switch to the main branch, pull the changes associated with the pull request and
  update the version of the project stated in
  [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/blob/main/pyproject.toml):

    ```bash
    git switch main
    git pull
    uv version VERSION
    ```

    where `VERSION` is the version.

* Commit and push this change:
  
    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Updated project version."
    git push
    ```

### 3. Create release tag

* Associate tag `VERSION` (the version considered in the previous step) with the latest
  commit and push the tag to the remote repo:

    ```bash
    git tag VERSION
    git push origin VERSION
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> #### Semantic versioning
> `VERSION` must satisfy the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules as
> described in the table below.
>
> | Release Type      | Example         |
> | ----------------- | --------------- |
> | Major release     | v1.0.0          |
> | Minor release     | v1.1.0          |
> | Patch release     | v1.1.1          |
> | Alpha pre-release | v1.1.1-alpha.1  |
> | Beta pre-release  | v1.1.1-beta.1   |
> | Release candidate | v1.1.1.-rc.1    |

### 4. Let GitHub Actions automatically build and publish the package to PyPI

* After pushing the tag, the package is automatically built and published to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) by GitHub using workflow file
[`build-publish-package.yml`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-publish-package.yml).
The published new version of the package would then appear in the project
[`pingi`](https://pypi.org/project/pingi/) hosted in the PyPI website. Note that
the Continuous Integration workflow file
[`ci.yml`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
is identically run since it is triggered by any kind of push.

### 5. (Optional) Create GitHub release

* If desired, create a [GitHub
  release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
  by going to the GitHub page, clicking on
  [`Releases`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/releases), then [`Draft a new
  release`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/releases/new) and issuing a title
  (usually the project version `VERSION`) and some notes. After this, the GitHub release
  would then appear in the
  [`Releases`](https://github.com/eliocp/pingi/releases) section of the repo
  GitHub page.

> [!NOTE]
> #### GitHub release
> GitHub releases are portable "snapshots" of a specific version (commit) of the
> project containing release notes and source archives (`zip` and `tar.gz` files)
> which may be used in other contexts outside of GitHub.
